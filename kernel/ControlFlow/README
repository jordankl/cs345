you can choose between three options to divide the number 10. 
The first option is to enter a number. 
	if you enter zero it will jump to the error handler and print out a "divide by zero error". 
	if you enter another number it will return the result.
	either one you enter it will then give the same 3 options
The second option is to enter a character
	when you enter a character it will return a different error code and print out a "type char error"
	then return back to the 3 options
